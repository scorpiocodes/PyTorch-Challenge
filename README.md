# PyTorch-Challenge
PyTorch is an open source deep learning framework that’s quickly become popular with AI researchers for its ease of use, clean Pythonic API, and flexibility. With the preview release of PyTorch 1.0, developers can now seamlessly move from exploration to production deployment using a single, unified framework.

This new scholarship program, announced today at the PyTorch Developer Conference, offers participants the opportunity to acquire cutting-edge skills in deep learning using PyTorch, and earn a full scholarship to Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree program.

Facebook’s support and investment will make 10,000 seats available for a new Udacity Challenge Course; “Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch.” Upon successfully completing the first phase of the program, 300 students will then go on to earn full scholarships.
